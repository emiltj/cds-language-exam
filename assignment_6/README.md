<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description
_Winter is... hopefully over._

In class this week, we've seen how deep learning models like CNNs can be used for text classification purposes. For your assignment this week, I want you to see how successfully you can use these kind of models to classify a specific kind of cultural data - scripts from the TV series Game of Thrones.

You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons)

In particular, I want you to see how accurately you can model the relationship between each season and the lines spoken. That is to say - can you predict which season a line comes from? Or to phrase that another way, is dialogue a good predictor of season?
* Start by making a baseline using a 'classical' ML solution such as CountVectorization + LogisticRegression and use this as a means of evaluating how well your model performs.
* Then you should try to come up with a solution which uses a DL model, such as the CNNs we went over in class.

<!-- METHODS -->
## Methods

**Specifically for this assignment:**

For the Logistic Regression (LR) classification task, I start by loading in the data. I then do a stratified train-test split of the data, as the data set is unbalanced. Stratification locks the distribution of classes in the train and test sets - i.e. if season 1 entries account for 23% of the entire dataset, then both the train and test set will consist of 23% data from season 1. The dialogue is then vectorized. The sentences are converted to vectors as CNN's only take vectors as input. Each number in the vectors represent a word index in a vocabulary list (which contains the feature names). The feature vectors and the labels from the training data are then used to train the LR classifer, a model which is subsequently tested on the test split. A classification matrix is saved, a long with a confusion matrix to the folder ```out``` .

For the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classification task, the data is split up into a train-test split using stratification.



**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**

I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:

* Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
* Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
* Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see "Optional arguments" section for more information)
