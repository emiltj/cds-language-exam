<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description
_Winter is... hopefully over._

In class this week, we've seen how deep learning models like CNNs can be used for text classification purposes. For your assignment this week, I want you to see how successfully you can use these kind of models to classify a specific kind of cultural data - scripts from the TV series Game of Thrones.

You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons)

In particular, I want you to see how accurately you can model the relationship between each season and the lines spoken. That is to say - can you predict which season a line comes from? Or to phrase that another way, is dialogue a good predictor of season?
* Start by making a baseline using a 'classical' ML solution such as CountVectorization + LogisticRegression and use this as a means of evaluating how well your model performs.
* Then you should try to come up with a solution which uses a DL model, such as the CNNs we went over in class.

## Usage

Make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md located at the parent level of this repository, for the required installation of the virtual environment as well as the data download.

Subsequently, use the following code (when within the ```cds-language-exam``` folder):

```bash
cd assignment_3
source ../lang101/bin/activate # If not already activated
python ___________________________________________________________________.py
```

### Optional arguments:

image_search.py arguments for commandline to consider:
-       "-f"
        "--filepath", 
        type = str,
        default = os.path.join("data", "*.jpg"), # Default path to corpus, when none is specified
        required = False,
        help= "str - path to image corpus")
