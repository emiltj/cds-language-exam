<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description

This assignment seeks to generative new textual content by implementing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). More specifically, this assignment seeks see whether it is possible to generate new textual content in line with the text from [the corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/tschomacker/grimms-fairy-tales) of folklore fairytales written by the Brothers Grimm (Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm). The project intends to investigate the questions: _How well can a neural network learn the patterns of the writings of the Brothers Grimm?_ and _Using the trained model - is it possible to generate new textual content that could have been something you read in an old fairytale?_.

Try using a text generative approach that learns and predicts on word-level, rather than on a character-level.

* Train a Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM) artificial Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on the corpus
* Use sequences of 50 words as input for the model
* Bonus task: include arguments that let you specify model training parameters and LTSM model architecture (LTSM layers, epochs and batch size)
* Bonus task: include arguments that let you specify options for the generated texts. How many text chunks should be generated? What should be the length of the text chunks?

<!-- METHODS -->
## Methods

**Specifically for this assignment:**

For this assignment I started out by loading in the text corpus. The text was then preprocessed; all strings were appended to one long string. I tokenized the data up into the individual words, removed all non-alphanumeric characters and vectorized the data - having the text as integers instead of as strings to allow the model to train on the data. I defined and made use of a function retrieves word sequences using a moving window (e.g. ["once", "upon", "a", "time", "in"] becomes the sequences: [["once upon a"], ["upon a time"], ["a time in"]] with window size 3 and step size 1). I chose to retrieve sequences of size 51. These first 50 tokens in each sequence would be used as features for the model input, while the last token in the sequence would be what the model tries to predict. The list of tokens to predict are then one-hot encoded to match the shape for a keras model that uses categorical crossentropy as loss function and softmax activation for the final layer.

**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**

I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:
* Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
* Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
* Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see <a href="#optional-arguments">"Optional arguments"</a> section for more information)

<!-- RESULTS AND DISCUSSION -->
## Results and discussion

**Topic prevalence in schools of philosophical thought**

<em> 
Plot showing the topic prevalence of the different schools of philosophical thought
</em>
</a>

When looking at the schools' topic prevalences the first thing that comes up is the high prevalence of topic 4 in the school of Aristotle. Topic 3 seems quite prevalent in books on Feminism, while Plato and Stoicms seems to be unrelated to most topics, say for topic 3.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

Make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md located at the parent level of this repository, for the required installation of the virtual environment as well as the data download.

Subsequently, use the following code (when within the ```cds-language-exam``` folder):

```bash
cd assignment_7
source ../lang101/bin/activate # If not already activated
python text_generator.py
```

### Optional arguments:

text_generator.py arguments for commandline to consider:
-       "-i",
        "--inpath", 
        type = str,
        default = os.path.join("data", "philosophy_data.csv"), # Default path to data
        required = False,
        help= "str - path to image corpus")
