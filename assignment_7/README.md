<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description


<!-- METHODS -->
## Methods

**Specifically for this assignment:**

For this assignment

**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**

I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:
* Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
* Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
* Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see <a href="#optional-arguments">"Optional arguments"</a> section for more information)

<!-- RESULTS AND DISCUSSION -->

<em> 
Plot showing the topic prevalence of the different schools of philosophical thought
</em>
</a>

When looking at the schools' topic prevalences the first thing that comes up is the high prevalence of topic 4 in the school of Aristotle. Topic 3 seems quite prevalent in books on Feminism, while Plato and Stoicms seems to be unrelated to most topics, say for topic 3.
