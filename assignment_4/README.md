<!-- ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION -->
## Assignment description
This command-line tool will take a given dataset and perform simple network analysis. In particular, it will build networks based on entities appearing together in the same documents, like we did in class.

Your script should be able to be run from the command line
It should take any weighted edgelist as an input, providing that edgelist is saved as a CSV with the column headers "nodeA", "nodeB"
For any given weighted edgelist given as an input, your script should be used to create a network visualization, which will be saved in a folder called viz.
It should also create a data frame showing the degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality for each node. It should save this as a CSV in a folder called output.

<!-- METHODS -->
## Methods

**Specifically for this assignment:**

**On a more general level (this applies to all assignments):**
I have tried to as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This has been attempted by the use of:
* Smaller functions. These are intended to solve the sub-tasks of the assignment. This is meant to improve readability of the script, as well as simplifying the use of the script.
* Information prints. Information is printed to the terminal to allow the user to know what is being processed in the background
* Argparsing. Arguments that let the user determine the behaviour and paths of the script (see <a href="#optional-arguments">"Optional arguments"</a> section for more information)

## Usage

Make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md located at the parent level of this repository, for the required installation of the virtual environment as well as the data download.

Subsequently, use the following code (when within the ```cds-language-exam``` folder):

```bash
cd assignment_3
source ../lang101/bin/activate # If not already activated
python ___________________________________________________________________.py
```

### Optional arguments:

image_search.py arguments for commandline to consider:
-       "-f"
        "--filepath", 
        type = str,
        default = os.path.join("data", "*.jpg"), # Default path to corpus, when none is specified
        required = False,
        help= "str - path to image corpus")
